# Bosun

An opinionated multi-agent coding environment built on [Pi](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-mono). Agents run in tmux windows, coordinate through a mesh, and a background daemon handles the rest.

## What you get

**Agents that work together.** Spawn a test runner while you write code. Delegate a file search to a scout. Get a code review from a dedicated reviewer. Each agent runs in its own tmux window with the right model and tools for the job.

**Coordination built in.** Agents reserve files before editing them, send messages to each other, and know who's working on what. No stepping on each other's work.

**Background automation.** A daemon summarizes your sessions, generates builder's logs, fills in handoffs, and backs up your workspace — all on a schedule, without you thinking about it.

**Sandboxed by default.** Process-level isolation via bubblewrap. Tool-level access control for reads, writes, and commands. Agents can only touch what you allow.

**Extensible foundation.** Every piece is an independent Pi package. Use them standalone, or build your own multi-agent environment on top of bosun as a git submodule.

## Who it's for

Bosun is for developers who want a multi-agent setup without building the infrastructure. If you've used Pi and wanted to run multiple agents simultaneously — with coordination, automation, and sandboxing — bosun is that, pre-configured.

It's opinionated. The agent tiers, the tmux workflow, the daemon system — these are choices made for you. That's the point.

## Quick start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/oddship/bosun.git
cd bosun
just onboard        # install deps, create config
# edit config.toml with your API keys
just start          # sandboxed tmux session
```

Inside the session:

```
You: Explore this codebase and then add rate limiting to the API

Bosun: I'll spawn scout for recon, then plan the implementation.
```
